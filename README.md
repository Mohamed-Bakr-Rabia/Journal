# NewsFeed 

I would like to share with you my first app published on the Google Play Store.

I built the **Guardian NewsFeed** app from scratch. I made use of the design of my News app one of the Android Basics Nanodegree projects, which is on this GitHub, but the code is different from my News app. I added the podcast feature which allows you to stream the guardian podcasts for free.

The differences are as follows.
*	Use the Paging library to load news data gradually and gracefully, so that you do not need to adjust the Number of Items in the Settings
*	Search articles by keyword
*	Add Podcast section. You can listen to Guardian podcasts anywhere, anytime for free, add favorite episodes, download episodes for offline listening
*	Use Constraint layout which allows you to make complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy
*	Use Third-party libraries – Android Architecture Components, Android Data Binding, Retrofit, Gson, OkHttp, ExoPlayer, Glide, Glide Transformations, SimpleXmlConverter, Timber, Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics
*	Replace Toast message with SnackBar message
*	Minimum SDK is 16, Android 4.1 (JELLY_BEAN)
*	Add the launcher icon that I created

I’m happy that I was able to build something useful, and I want to thank you for your support.
Please note that this app is not an open source app. If you have any issues, please feel free to contact me. Your comments and suggestions are important to me. I love your feedback.
